# Arduino-HelloWorld
A very quick Hello World demo with an ASCII counter with an Arduino

This is a very fast simple example getting an Arduino Uno displaying on a Matrix Orbital I2C Display. 

The blocks for this program are:
1.	Arduino Configuration
2.	Display Configuration
3.	Start of the program
4.	Main Loop of the program

What you fill see on the screen on start

Line 1: Hello World!

Line 2: The ASCII/FONT table of the display starting at 0x30 which is ASCII “0” to 0xFC
